BEEFY is a consensus protocol designed with efficient trustless bridging in mind. It means
that building a light client of BEEFY protocol should be optimized for restricted environments
like Ethereum Smart Contracts or On-Chain State Transition Function (e.g. Substrate Runtime).
Note that BEEFY is not a standalone protocol, it is meant to be running alongside GRANDPA, a
finality gadget created for Substrate/Polkadot ecosystem. More details about GRANDPA can be found in
the [whitepaper](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa.pdf).

Following document is a semi-formal description of the protocol augmented with high-level
implementation suggestions and notes. Any changes to the implementation in Substrate repository
should be preceded by updates to this document.

Current Version: 0.1.0

# Introduction

The original motiviation for introducing BEEFY is stemming from inefficiencies of building
GRANDPA light client in restricted environments.

1. GRANDPA uses `ed25519` signatures and finality proof requires `2N/3 + 1` of valid signatures
   (where `N` is the size of current validator set).
1. GRANDPA finalizes `Headers`, which by default in Substrate is at least `100 bytes` (3 hashes +
   block number). Additionally the finality proof may contain `votes_ancestries` which are also
   headers, so the total size is inflated by that. This extraneuous data is useless for the light
   client though.
1. Since GRANDPA depends on the header format, which is customizable in Substrate, it makes it hard
   to build a "Generic Light Client" which would be able to support multiple different chains.

Hence the goals of BEEFY are:

1. Allow customisation of crypto to adapt for different targets. Support thresholds signatures as
   well eventually.
1. Minimize the size of the "signed payload" and the finality proof.
1. Unify data types and use backward-compatible versioning so that the protocol can be extended
   (additional payload, different crypto) without breaking existing light clients.

BEEFY is required to be running on top of GRANDPA. This allows us to take couple of shortcuts:
1. BEEFY validator set is **the same** as GRANDPA's (i.e. the same bonded actors), they might be
   identified by different session keys though.
1. BEEFY runs on **finalized** canonical chain, i.e. no forks (note [Misbehavior](#2-misbehavior)
   section though).
1. From a single validator perspective, BEEFY has at most one active voting round. Since GRANDPA
   validators are reaching finality, we assume they are on-line and well-connected and have
   similar view of the state of the blockchain.

## Ethereum

Initial version of BEEFY was made to enable efficient bridging with Ethereum, where the light client
is a Solidity Smart Contract compiled to EVM bytecode. Hence the choice of the initial cryptography
for BEEFY: `secp256k1` and usage of `keccak256` hashing function. See more in
[Data Formats](#2-data-formats) section.

# The BEEFY Protocol

## Mental Model

BEEFY should be considered as an extra voting round done by GRANDPA validators for the current best
finalized block. Similarily to how GRANDPA is lagging behind best produced (non-finalized) block,
BEEFY is going to lag behind best GRANDPA (finalized) block.

```
                       ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐
                       │      │ │      │ │      │ │      │ │      │
                       │  B1  │ │  B2  │ │  B3  │ │  B4  │ │  B5  │
                       │      │ │      │ │      │ │      │ │      │
                       └──────┘ └───▲──┘ └──────┘ └───▲──┘ └───▲──┘
                                    │                 │        │
     Best BEEFY block───────────────┘                 │        │
                                                      │        │
     Best GRANDPA block───────────────────────────────┘        │
                                                               │
     Best produced block───────────────────────────────────────┘

```

A pseudo-algorithm of behavior for a fully-synced BEEFY validator is:

```
loop {
  let (best_beefy_block, best_grandpa_block) = wait_for_best_blocks();

  let block_to_vote_on = choose_next_beefy_block(
    best_beefy_block,
    best_grandpa_block
  );

  let payload_to_vote_on = retrieve_payload(block_to_vote_on);

  let commitment = (block_to_vote_on, payload_to_vote_on);

  let signature = sign_with_current_session_key(commitment);

  broadcast_vote(commitment, signature);
}
```

## Details

Before we jump into describing how BEEFY works in details, let's agree on the terms we are going to
use and actors in the system. All nodes in the network need to participate in the BEEFY networking
protocol, but we can identify two distinct actors though: **regular nodes** and **BEEFY validators**.
Validators are expected to actively participate in the protocol, by producing and broadcasting
**votes**. Votes are simply their signatures over a **Commitment**. A Commitment consists of a
**payload** (an opaque blob of bytes extracted from a block or state at that block, expected to be some
form of crypto accumulator (like Merkle Tree Hash or Merkle Mountain Range Root Hash)) and **block
number** from which this payload originates. Additionally Commitment contains BEEFY **validator
set id** at that particular block. Note the block is finalized, so there is no ambiguity despite
using block number instead of a hash. A collection of **votes**, or rather
a Commitment and a collection of signatures is going to be called **Signed Commitment**. A valid
(see later for the rules) Signed Commitment is also called a **BEEFY Justification** or
**BEEFY Finality Proof**. For more details on the actual data structures please see
[Data Formats](#2-data-formats).

A **round** is an attempt by BEEFY validators to produce BEEFY Justification. **Round number** is
simply defined as a block number (or rather the Commitment for that block number) the validators are
voting for. Round ends when the next round is started or when we receive all expected votes from all
validators.

Validators are expected to:
1. Produce & broadcast vote for

# Assorted notes

Only one round is always active and it's in either of the modes:

Mandatory mode
 - force sync to request beefy justifcations for this block
 - listen to justification imports
 - vote

Non-mandatory mode
 - listen to  justification imports
 - vote on a block according to power-of-two rule


How to get the initial state?


We gossip votes for the current round.

We gossip justifications for some past rounds?
