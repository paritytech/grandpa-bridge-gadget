//! Primitives for BEEFY protocol.
//!
//! The crate contains shared data types used by BEEFY protocol and documentation (in a form of
//! code) for building a BEEFY light client.
//!
//! BEEFY is a gadget that runs alongside another finality gadget (for instance GRANDPA).
//! For simplicity (and the initially intended use case) the documentation says GRANDPA in places
//! where a more abstract "Finality Gadget" term could be used, but there is no reason why BEEFY
//! wouldn't run with some other finality scheme.
//! BEEFY validator set is supposed to be tracking the Finality Gadget validator set, but note that
//! it will use a different set of keys. For Polkadot use case we plan to use `secp256k1` for BEEFY,
//! while GRANDPA uses `ed25519`.
